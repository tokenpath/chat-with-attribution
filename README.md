# chat-with-page

**TLDR** is a Chrome MV3 extension for chatting with text selected on a web
page. Select text, right-click **TLDR**, then use the side panel to summarize it
or ask follow-up questions. TokenPath returns attributed answer spans; clicking
one highlights and scrolls to its exact source text in the page.

## Load it unpacked

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Choose **Load unpacked** and select `tldr-extension/`.
4. Select text on a normal web page, right-click, and choose **TLDR**.

On first use, paste a TokenPath API key from
[platform.tokenpath.ai](https://platform.tokenpath.ai). No separate LLM key is
needed.

Selections of 24 words or fewer are already concise, so the extension skips the
automatic model summary. Longer selections get an adaptive TL;DR prompt and
output-token ceiling that scale with the source while remaining shorter than it.
Long CJK text uses an equivalent character budget instead of being mistaken for
a one-word selection.

## How it works

1. Content scripts run from `document_start` in every frame. They snapshot the
   live selection and eagerly extract it on `contextmenu`, before a dynamic page
   such as Gmail, WhatsApp, or Substack can replace or normalize its DOM
   selection.
2. The background worker starts an idempotent injection into the exact source
   frame, covering tabs that were open before an extension reload. It opens the
   side panel without awaiting its animation and captures immediately. A missing
   listener or stale capture response is retried once after injection. Once the
   DOM map is safely captured, the native page selection is cleared.
3. One authenticated `POST /v1/answer` request generates the grounded answer and
   returns server-selected attribution spans. Each span contains character
   bounds in both the answer and the selected source document. TokenPath's
   Unicode code-point bounds are converted once to JavaScript UTF-16 offsets,
   including across emoji and other astral-plane characters.
4. The panel renders those answer spans as clickable claims. Clicking one sends
   its converted source bounds to the originating tab and frame.
5. The content script maps those document offsets back to live DOM `Range`s,
   highlights the source with the CSS Custom Highlight API, and scrolls it into
   view, including through nested panes such as Gmail's message view.

Character bounds disambiguate repeated strings in the original extraction.
Before navigating, the extension validates only the clicked attribution's
source span, so unrelated hydration elsewhere in a long selection cannot break
an unchanged target. If a dynamic page replaces the target subtree, a shared
resolver searches only beneath the original Gmail or WhatsApp message, X
post/status/article identity, uniquely headed semantic article, or conservative
generic scope. Its case-sensitive quote projection tolerates text-node
split/merge and block-wrapper whitespace changes; bounded prefix/suffix context
disambiguates reordered repeats. Exact source identities and validated paths
keep other messages or surviving duplicates from stealing the highlight.
Changed routes, changed targets, and ambiguous matches fail instead of jumping
to the first copy.

Late-injection recovery also handles invisible formatting characters, Unicode
whitespace, CSS-uppercase text, and effective `user-select` overrides. This
excludes genuinely unselectable controls on Substack and X while accepting
WhatsApp message text re-enabled beneath its non-selectable app shell.

Only the extracted selection, questions, and bounded conversation context are
sent to TokenPath. The DOM node map remains inside the source frame.

## API and local development

The side panel calls TokenPath directly using the key stored in
`chrome.storage.local`. To use staging or a local backend, run this in the panel
DevTools console:

```js
chrome.storage.local.set({ tokenpathBaseUrl: "http://localhost:8000" })
```

See [`tokenpath-integration.md`](./tokenpath-integration.md) for request shapes
and [`spec.md`](./spec.md) for the extension architecture.
